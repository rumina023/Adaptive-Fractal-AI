# Adaptive Fractal AI

Adaptive Fractal AI is a framework designed to efficiently handle complex tasks using fractal structures. This system enables dynamic task division, priority queuing, cache management, and multimodal data integration, making efficient use of computational resources.

## Key Features
- **Fractal Structure**: Efficient hierarchical task division.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Parallel processing with priority-based task queues.
- **Multimodal Support**: Integrated processing of different data formats such as text and images.
- **Resource Management**: Monitors CPU and memory usage to prevent overload.
- **Knowledge Generation**: Generates and accumulates new knowledge based on task results.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/adaptive-fractal-ai.git
   cd adaptive-fractal-ai
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Example
Here is a simple example of using this framework:

```python
from adaptive_fractal_ai import AdaptiveFractalAI

# Create a new AI instance
ai = AdaptiveFractalAI(max_depth=5, branching_factor=3)

# Register a text processing function
def process_text(data):
    return data.upper()

ai.register_modality("text", process_text)

# Register and execute a task
async def main():
    await ai.process_task(priority=1, task_complexity=4, modalities={"text": "example"})
    await ai.incremental_processing()

asyncio.run(main())
```
